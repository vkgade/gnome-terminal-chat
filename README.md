gnome-terminal-chat
===================

A chat program in C using network sockets.
This is TO-DO list more than a read me.

The code is not commented. I will do it soon !!
And code is not complete, the threads are not really managed well, need to do some IPC.
The present program compiles right but it just accepts connections. 
Need to add more commands, starting with 'connect', which is not yet implemented.
Next need to manage the I/O for each connection by creating separate terminals. May be using termios.
Chat can be made more neat looking using ncurses. 

For now this is all. More features to be added. If everything goes good.
